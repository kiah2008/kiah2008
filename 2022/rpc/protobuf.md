# 介绍

> [protobuf github](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf)

Protocol Buffers (a.k.a., protobuf) are Google's language-neutral, platform-neutral, extensible mechanism for serializing structured data. You can find [protobuf's documentation on the Google Developers site](https://developers.google.cn/protocol-buffers/).

This README file contains protobuf installation instructions. To install protobuf, you need to install the protocol compiler (used to compile .proto files) and the protobuf runtime for your chosen programming language.
