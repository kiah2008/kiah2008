we will show you how to install and use **SSHFS** client on any Linux distribution to mount remote Linux filesystem or directory on a local Linux machine.

#### Step 1: Install SSHFS Client in Linux Systems

By default **sshfs** packages does not exists on all major Linux distributions, you need to enable [epel repository](https://www.tecmint.com/how-to-enable-epel-repository-for-rhel-centos-6-5/) under your Linux systems to install sshfs with the help of **Yum** command with their dependencies.

```
# yum install sshfs
# dnf install sshfs              [On Fedora 22+ releases]
$ sudo apt-get install sshfs     [On Debian/Ubuntu based systems]
```

#### Step 2: Creating SSHFS Mount Directory

Once the sshfs package installed, you need to create a mount point directory where you will mount your remote file system. For example, we have created mount directory under `/mnt/tecmint`.

```
# mkdir /mnt/tecmint
$ sudo mkdir /mnt/tecmint     [On Debian/Ubuntu based systems]
```

#### Step 3: Mounting Remote Filesystem with SSHFS

Once you have created your mount point directory, now run the following command as a **root** user to mount remote file system under `/mnt/tecmint`. In your case the mount directory would be anything.

The following command will mount remote directory called `/home/tecmint` under `/mnt/tecmint` in local system. (Don’t forget replace **x.x.x.x** with your IP Address and mount point).

```
# sshfs tecmint@x.x.x.x:/home/tecmint/ /mnt/tecmint
$ sudo sshfs -o allow_other tecmint@x.x.x.x:/home/tecmint/ /mnt/tecmint     [On Debian/Ubuntu based systems]
```

If your Linux server is configured with SSH key based authorization, then you will need to specify the path to your public keys as shown in the following command.

```
# sshfs -o IdentityFile=~/.ssh/id_rsa tecmint@x.x.x.x:/home/tecmint/ /mnt/tecmint
$ sudo sshfs -o allow_other,IdentityFile=~/.ssh/id_rsa tecmint@x.x.x.x:/home/tecmint/ /mnt/tecmint     [On Debian/Ubuntu based systems]
```

#### Step 4: Verifying Remote Filesystem is Mounted

If you have run the above command successfully without any errors, you will see the list of remote files and directories mounted under `/mnt/tecmint`.

```
# cd /mnt/tecmint
# ls
[root@ tecmint]# ls
12345.jpg                       ffmpeg-php-0.6.0.tbz2                Linux                                           news-closeup.xsl     s3.jpg
cmslogs                         gmd-latest.sql.tar.bz2               Malware                                         newsletter1.html     sshdallow
epel-release-6-5.noarch.rpm     json-1.2.1                           movies_list.php                                 pollbeta.sql
ffmpeg-php-0.6.0                json-1.2.1.tgz                       my_next_artical_v2.php                          pollbeta.tar.bz2
```

#### Step 5: Checking Mount Point with df -hT Command

If you run **df -hT** command you will see the remote file system mount point.

```
# df -hT
```

##### Sample Output

```
Filesystem                          Type        Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
udev                                devtmpfs    730M     0  730M   0% /dev
tmpfs                               tmpfs       150M  4.9M  145M   4% /run

tmpfs                               tmpfs       150M   44K  150M   1% /run/user/1000
tecmint@192.168.0.102:/home/tecmint fuse.sshfs  324G   55G  253G  18% /mnt/tecmint
```

#### Step 6: Mounting Remote Filesystem Permanently

To mount remote filesystem permanently, you need to edit the file called `/etc/fstab`. To do, open the file with your favorite editor.

```
# vi /etc/fstab
$ sudo vi /etc/fstab     [On Debian/Ubuntu based systems]         
```

Go to the bottom of the file and add the following line to it and save the file and exit. The below entry mount remote server file system with default settings.

```
sshfs#tecmint@x.x.x.x:/home/tecmint/ /mnt/tecmint fuse.sshfs defaults 0 0
```

Make sure you’ve [SSH Passwordless Login](https://www.tecmint.com/ssh-passwordless-login-using-ssh-keygen-in-5-easy-steps/) in place between servers to auto mount filesystem during system reboots..

If your server is configured with SSH key based authorization, then add this line:

```
sshfs#tecmint@x.x.x.x:/home/tecmint/ /mnt/tecmint fuse.sshfs IdentityFile=~/.ssh/id_rsa defaults 0 0
```

Next, you need to update the fstab file to reflect the changes.

```
# mount -a
$ sudo mount -a   [On Debian/Ubuntu based systems]
```

#### Step 7: Unmounting Remote Filesystem

To unmount remote filesystem, jun issue the following command it will unmount the remote file system.

```
# umount /mnt/tecmint
```
